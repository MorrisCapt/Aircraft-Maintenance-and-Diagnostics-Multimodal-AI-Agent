Real-time aircraft maintenance and diagnostics using a multimodal agent in the aviation industry:

Use Case: Real-Time Aircraft Maintenance and Diagnostics with a Multimodal AI Agent

Problem Statement:
Aircraft maintenance requires rapid and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure safety and reduce downtime. Currently, technicians rely on siloed data sources like:
- Technical manuals (text),
- Pilot reports (audio/text),
- Sensor data (numerical/logs),
- Visual inspections (images/videos).

Interpreting all these inputs manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially during emergency maintenance or turnaround operations.


 Solution: Multimodal AI Agent

A multimodal agent integrates and analyzes data from multiple sources to provide real-time maintenance support.  

 Inputs Handled:
-  Image: Photos of damaged parts or wear & tear.
-  Text: Maintenance manuals, fault logs, compliance checklists.
-  Audio: Verbal pilot or crew feedback (e.g., cockpit voice recordings).
-  Sensor Data: Live aircraft system metrics (engine temperature, hydraulic pressure, vibration levels, etc.).


How It Works:

1. Data Ingestion:  
   The technician uses a mobile device to:
   - Upload an image of a faulty landing gear component,
   - Input a brief note describing observed issues,
   - Link real-time sensor logs from the onboard system.

2. Multimodal Processing:  
   The AI agent:
   - Uses computer vision to analyze the image (e.g., detect cracks or corrosion),
   - Reads the technician's notes and matches them with maintenance procedures,
   - Analyzes sensor data to detect abnormal patterns or system failures.

3. Recommendation Generation:  
   The agent outputs:
   - A diagnosis (e.g., “Hydraulic actuator seal degradation”),
   - The relevant repair procedure** from the manual,
   - An estimated repair time and part list,
   - A regulatory compliance checklist** to ensure all protocols are met.

4. Report Generation:  
   - Creates a full maintenance report with findings, actions taken, and parts used,
   - Integrates with the airline’s Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) system.
